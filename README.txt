- Game Overview -
"A Gentle Wind" is a text-based exploration game that simulates navigating through a dense forest. The player moves between different areas, each described by a short text narrative. The goal is to find the exit area, which is marked by a bike, and escape the forest.

The game takes place in a 16 cell area, where each cell represents a different area of the forest. Every area has paths linking it to other areas. As the player progresses, paths may shift due to environmental changes like the "gentle wind."

- Gameplay -
Objective:
The objective of the game is to explore the forest and find the exit, which is represented by an old mountain bike. Along the way, the player will encounter various areas, each with different paths to explore. The player must make choices that lead them closer to the exit while avoiding getting lost in the forest.

Controls:
When the game starts, type START at the prompt to begin.
The player will be presented with areas described in text and different paths to choose from.
The player chooses paths by typing A, B, or C to navigate to a new area.
If the player reaches the area with the bike, they win the game.

Map Layout:
The forest is divided into a linked system of 16 areas. Each area has 1 to 3 possible paths that the player can follow. Some areas may become connected or disconnected as the game progresses, influenced by in-game events like the "gentle wind."

Win Condition:
You win the game when you find the exit area containing the bike and leave the forest.

- Features -
Dynamic Area Generation: The grid layout of the forest is randomly generated at the start of each game. The path descriptions are also randomly assigned, ensuring a unique experience each time.
Path Shifting: As the player progresses, paths may be added or removed, simulating a "gentle wind" that shifts the forest around.
Simple Navigation: Players can explore the forest by choosing from paths described by text. The map is designed to be easy to navigate, even with changing connections between areas.
Replayable: The random generation of paths and areas means the game is different each time you play.

- How to Play -
Start the Game: Once the game loads, you will be presented with the main menu. Type START to begin your adventure.

Explore the Forest: As you navigate the grid, you will encounter areas with different descriptions. Each area will provide you with 1-3 available paths to explore.

Choose Your Path:

If there are multiple paths, you will be given options labeled A, B, or C.
Type the corresponding letter to move to the next area.
Keep track of your current location, as paths can change over time.
Reach the Exit: Your goal is to find the exit area containing the bike. Once you reach this area, the game will end with a victory message.

Enjoy the Journey: Explore the different areas, each with unique descriptions and paths. The game encourages exploration and experimentation with different routes.
